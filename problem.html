<h1>The dangers of Blacklegged Ticks within Toronto's major parks</h1>
<h2>Ideal</h2>
<p>To promote awareness on the rising cases of the invasive blacklegged tick population within Toronto's parks through a user-friendly interactive map. </p>
<h2>Reality</h2>
<p>Lack of public and user-friendly web interactive map. The City of Toronto currently only provides raw data, but not a web map for users to view certain locations of the blacklegged ticks in the parks. As well, most of the population in Ontario resides in Toronto and the city is a hub for tourism. </p>
<h2>Consequences</h2>
<p>Lyme disease has been on a rising high, it's impacted the health of hundreds of people within Ontario and even major Canadian celebrities (have raised awareness.) The harmful ticks are destructive to other ecosystems and mamamals. The disease currently carries no permanent cure. </p>
<h2>Proposal</h2>
<p>To promote awareness on the rising cases of the invasive blacklegged tick population within Toronto's parks through a user-friendly interactive map. </p>
